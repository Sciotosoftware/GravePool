    /*REQUIREMENTS
        The Grave Pool is a core piece of the game. At its core, Gravepool is a "castle defense" game
        requiring the careful management of A)natural resources and B)population to
        protect the GravePool at all costs!
        -The Game is Over if GravePool.purity reaches 0%
        -Every Longear born while GravePool.purity == 100 will have gain "Ancestors' Blessing".
        -Every (30 / GravePool.purity) minutes, a Wight will spawn randomly at the edge of the Map and race
            for the GravePool. Every Wraith that makes it to the Pool will reduce purity by 20.
        -Every set of Longear Bones allowed to deteriorate without being interred will produce an
            indestructible Wraith.
